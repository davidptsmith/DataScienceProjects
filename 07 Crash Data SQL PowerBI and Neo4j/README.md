**Note:**
Do not use the SQL ingestion code - yes I did, and yes I knew it was wrong (woops) but I knew that it was only for this dataset where I knew the origin and had gone through the data very carefully first. 

If you use the python code for ingesting the data to SQL you open youself up to a SQL Injection attack. Don't be like me, do it the right way (or not, itâ€™s really up to you but you have been warned!).
